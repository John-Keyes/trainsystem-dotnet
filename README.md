# DealerOn Test
- TrainRoutes Solution by John Keyes

## Summary
This project is a working solution to the trainsystems problem. In order to tackle this project, I chose to implement an object oriented design mainly because this is a graph problem and it is important to identify nodes(towns) and references to them.

Assume every input is through function parameters. There are more details on Program.cs.

### Kiwiland
- Kiwiland is a namespace that I created for anything that involves the train system.

#### Kiwiland.Models
- Kiwiland models is where I made a town and trip object that support the methods in the TrainSystem class.

#### Kiwiland.Tests
- This is where I see [this](Run-Unit-Tests) to run my fixed unit test.

## Run Unit Tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Run
```bash
dotnet run
```
